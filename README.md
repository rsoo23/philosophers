# philosophers

This project tackles the dining philosophers problem, where each philosopher can either eat, sleep, think or die. 

## Mandatory
This project taught me how to implement multithreading with mutex locks to prevent data races.

## Bonus
This bonus part taught me how to use semaphores instead of mutexes and child processes instead of threads to run the same dining philosophers' problem.
